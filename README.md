This is the repository for Team II's App 

Professor Chang this folder contains all the files needed to compile and run the Android app not just the ones we worked on. 

To get to the files we created go to: 
app > src > main and the files in the folders “java” and “res” along with the “AndroidManifest” file are what we created and worked on to create this app.
